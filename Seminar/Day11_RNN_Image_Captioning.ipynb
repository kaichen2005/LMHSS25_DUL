    "# Image Captioning with an Encoder-Decoder RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an image captioning model using a classic encoder-decoder architecture. This is a fascinating multi-modal task that combines Computer Vision (to understand the image) and Natural Language Processing (to generate a descriptive sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üìå The Core Idea: Encoder-Decoder**\n",
    "The model consists of two main parts that work together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Encoder**: A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), like ResNet, acts as the encoder. It takes an image as input and outputs a compact feature vector (an embedding). This vector is a rich, numerical representation of the image's content‚Äîits \"thought\" vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Decoder**: A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically an LSTM in our case, acts as the decoder. It takes the image's feature vector from the encoder and generates the caption one word at a time. It learns the statistical structure of language to produce coherent sentences."

Attention allows the decoder to dynamically focus on different parts of the image as it generates each word, often leading to more accurate and contextually relevant captions. This is a key component in modern sequence-to-sequence models.\n",
